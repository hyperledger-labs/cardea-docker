A self signed SSL certificate is autogenerated at nginx/ssl/my-site.com.(key|crt). You can provide your own keys here, or modify the scripts to use an alternate key.

One method is to use Let's Encrypt:

https://letsencrypt.org/


First, checkout the repository.

    git clone ...

Then get the git submodules

    git submodule update --init

If you are setting up the agents in a production environment, create an .env file for each enterprise agent (lab and government) with the following values customized for each (you can put these values in docker-compose-release.yml, but they would be overwritten with every new pull from github):
    WEB_ROOT=https://localhost:port_number_if_necessary
    JWT_SECRET=yoursecrethere (32 alpha-numeric digits, e.g. 1234567890ABCDEFHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW)
    SESSION_SECRET=yoursecrethere (32 alpha-numeric digits, e.g. 1234567890ABCDEFHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW)

We can finally start the docker containers by runnning

    docker-compose up

The first time you bring up the containers and agent(in a container or separate) or reset them, you must run the following script after the controller api containers have started:

    docker-compose exec government-api npm run first-time-setup
    docker-compose exec lab-api npm run first-time-setup

To reset all the containers, you can run:

    docker-compose rm

To remove just one container, you can run something like the following:

    docker-compose rm api

If you change the agent dependencies or version, you must start the docker containers with a --build flag:

    docker-compose up --build

If you want you can run the containers detached by adding the -d command. For more details about docker-compose up, you can run

    docker-compose up --help

If you need to execute commands in one of the running containers, you can run something like the following.

    docker-compose exec db sh

In the previous case we entered the db container and ran the command sh. Tab completion is helpful in seeing the list of containers available.

    $ docker-compose exec 
    api        db         ui         webserver
